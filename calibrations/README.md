These are the calibrations that have been made previously.

The pads are calibrated using a 3a source(maybe to be improved)

The DSSDs are calibrated using the proton spectrum from 21Mg(Erik phd, Decays At The Edge)

The gamma detectors are of unknown calibration(Should be Justus' that is used need to check)
