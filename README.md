This is my masters thesis project, which concerns itself with data of the beta decay of 22Al taken at FRIB in June-July 2023.

The analysis focuses on the beta-delayed single proton emission of the 22Al nucleus.
Inspiration is drawn from previous work on the same nucleus, where the focus was the beta-delayed two-proton emission.
This work can be found in Erik's git repo: https://gitlab.au.dk/ausa/erik/e21010

The analysis is far from done and will be updated along the way.
Only (hopefully) complete builds are uploaded to the git.
