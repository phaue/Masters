What is included in the different notebooks

BetaEffectivity.ipynb :
Estimation of the beta effectivity of the U4 telescope (id3)

eg.ipynb :
Visualization of beta cuts

Fits_id*_sub2p.ipynb :
These scripts are for each detector telescope usable for peak determination (id1,id2,id3 / U2,U3,U4). There is included a fitting function that extracts errors and counts where possible.
The procedure is the same for all three scripts that hold this name. The difference lies in the calculation of the calibration errors.

GammaPeaks_bg.ipynb :
Calculation of gamma events based on beta gated gamma spectra from the two detectors, G1 and G2. The beta effectivity used was the thresholded cut from the BetaEffectivity.ipynb analysis.

GrossBranchingDetermination.ipynb :
In this script the overall branching ratios are determined along with the feeding to the IAS in 22Mg. 
The 1p branching ratios are also defined in the very bottom on this script.

SingleP.ipynb :
Visualization tool of the single proton spectra. At the end of the script the final peak positions are determined based on read offs on a printed version of a zoomed in plot.

Weightedmeans.ipynb :
Calculates the weighted means of all the determined states both from the single proton analysis and the alpha analysis.
