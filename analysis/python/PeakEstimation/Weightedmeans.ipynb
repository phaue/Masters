    "The values here are extracted from Fits_id{1/2/3}_sub2p.ipynb scripts. These scripts are used to find the position of some of the peaks in the spectrum that are able to be fitted using gaussian fits. This provides the mean location and the true energy level location a long with their uncertainties. The uncertainties used are the calibration( ... and some other??). The values are listed in rising order such that the first value is from id1, next one is id2 and last on is id3. Now there are some places where only 1 or 2 detectors have peaks discernable in that specific range. And before the holiday i did not particularly describe which detectors were used. However one might guess that from looking at the spectrum from each detector.\n",
