What has been done here is first the CalibrationMatcher is run using any of the isotopes Mg or Si 
using their dummy-pad-sorted data. This creates a histogram for each pad for U1,U2 and U3 telescopes.
The reasoning being these detectors are thin enough such that their backing pad detectors have a good signal.

The resulting data are then compiled using hadd -f "specifiedfilename".root *{run numbers}*
to add all the individual run histograms into a single one. This file is then run in the fitter analysis.
This produces 4 fits to the peaks present in the pad spectrum. For Si all 4 are used, 
for Mg the first one is omitted.

These values are then hardcoded into the ForwardCalculation class and this class is now run on the 
dummy-pad-sorted data. This produces calculated pad-spectra for each of P1, P2 and P3.

These are then manually fitted using the ROOT software and used for the calibration which is carried out
in a python file called PadCalibration.ipynb. 

The code is not made general and i would like, at some point, to improve it with more dynamic casts.
Forexample loading in of the fitted values, make such that the fitter can fit the calculated pad-spectra. And make it so a config file can be used to choose between analysis methods in PadCalibration. I would also like to make the file paths and specifications not hardcoded but variable.
