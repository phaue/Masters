This calibration routine has not been optimized in any way whatsoever.
The steps presented for how the calibrations are to be carried out are therefore cumbersome. 
In future implementations of like analyses one could optimize this routine and filter some of the redundant scripts out. A lot of filler in the /include files and the overall script structure repeated from the actual analysis. 
However this will do for now.


How to:
(before proceeding to actual scripts)
Make sure you have a sorted set of data using the most up-to-date U-calibrations and then apply dummy calibrations to pads. store in data/dummypads_sorted/Si/

First of all: (from build folder)
./calibration/pad_calibration/padcal padmatcher.cfg ../data/dummypads_sorted/Si/*.root

This creates files where the calibrated DSSSD hits are paired with uncalibrated pad hits and saves them to histograms.


Then ->
./calibration/pad_calibration/finder padmatcher

This routine finds the peaks in the histograms generated from the first analysis


Then->
./calibration/pad_calibration/padcal padcalc.cfg ../data/dummypads_sorted/Si/*.root

This generates 3 new calculated histograms of the expected energy distributions in the pad detectors


Then ->
./calibration/pad_calibration/finder padcalc

Finds the peaks in the histograms.

Then -> 
run Python script PadCal.ipynb
Carries out the actual calibrations of the 3 pad detectors and visualizes them.
